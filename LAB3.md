===

##Description:

For this optional assignment, change your simple db to use promises instead of callbacks.

You can wrap the `fs` yourself, or use a library like [fs-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-promise)

## Testing
You will need to update your non-TCP tests to be promise based

##Rubric:

This is an optional assignment, bonus points are:

* Promises implemented correctly (through the layers): 5pts
* Update tests: 5pts
